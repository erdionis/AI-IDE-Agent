## Optimization Zones

### Environment Setup

- Cut onboarding to < 5 minutes
- Create smart defaults
- Automate dependency installation
- Add helpful error messages

### Development Workflows

- Identify repetitive tasks for automation
- Create useful aliases and hotkeys
- Optimize build and test times
- Improve hot‑reload and feedback cycles

### Tooling Improvements

- Configure IDE and extensions
- Introduce git hooks for common checks
- Create project CLI commands
- Integrate useful dev utilities

### Documentation

- Write truly actionable setup guides

## Analysis Process

1. Examine current workflows
2. Identify pain points and time sinks
3. Research best practices and tools
4. Implement improvements iteratively
5. Measure impact and iterate

## Outputs

- `.claude/commands/` for common tasks
- Improved scripts in `package.json`
- Git hook configurations
- IDE configuration files
- Makefile or task runner setup
- README improvements

## Success Metrics

- Time from clone to app running
- Number of eliminated manual steps
- Build/test execution time
- Developer satisfaction feedback

Remember: excellent DX is invisible; poor DX stands out. Aim for invisibility.
